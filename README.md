# Event-Planner
An event planner
I first began simplifing the TODO's and using the previous activities as references to complete the Event Planner

The html needed more div element to display the rest of the time's in the browser

In the javascript first todo I've added the variable to the saveBtn so that when the eventListener heres the click the function gets called
I then created the variables for text and id so it gets saved in the localstorage utilizing parent child relationship

In line 50 I made the function so that the variables currentTime and rowTime will follow the 'if' statement to compare the current hour with the other times

In the next part I made code of the hours so that the input gets saved in the localStorage

Finally I made the Variable timeDisplay and made the function that uses the local Variable to formate the dayjs to show the current date in the header of the page
